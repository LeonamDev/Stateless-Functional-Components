STATELESS FUNCTIONAL COMPONENTS

Stateless Functional Components and Props

Stateless functional components usually have props passed to them.

To access these props, give your stateless functional component a parameter. This parameter will automatically be equal to the component's props object.

It's customary to name this parameter props. Read Example.js to see how it works.

Not only are stateless functional components more concise, but they will subtly influence how you think about components in a positive way. They emphasize the fact that components are basically functions! A component takes two optional inputs, props and state, and outputs HTML and/or other components.

You'll be seeing a lot of stateless functional components in the next React course!
